# Building and running the LDS

## Build Dependencies

 * OPC UA Ansi C Stack 1.03.340. (included) Please review official site page http://opcfoundation.github.io/UA-AnsiC.
 * CMake version 3.6.2 or later from https://cmake.org/install/.
 * Perl
 * Windows:
    - OpenSSL 1.0.2j was used in development and testing: either built from source (https://www.openssl.org/source/) or as pre-built package, for example from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html.
    - Bonjour Mdns/dnssd (Multicast Domain Name System) client library (included)
 * Linux:
    - OpenSSL 1.0.2j was used in development and testing : (```sudo apt-get install libssl-dev```) (```sudo yum install openssl-devel```)  
    - Avahi 0.61 (or later) libdnssd compatibility layer: (```sudo apt-get install libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev```) (```sudo yum install avahi-compat-libdns_sd-devel```)  
 
## Building the LDS

Make sure that openssl is installed or build. See [UA-AnsiC](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-AnsiC/) build instructions.
<br/>
Predefined scripts are available based on CMake. 
 * Windows: build\_ualds.bat (Visual Studio Command Shell)
 * Linux: build\_linux.sh

## Runtime Dependencies

 * Windows: Bonjour Service (576.30.4)
 * Linux: Avahi Daemon (0.61 or later)

After a successful build, binary files will be in <build-folder>\bin\[config] and should work as is.
